                    close friends.

        Price control measures, like price ceilings work. They do not create shortages, they do not distort the price
        mechanism and they are good incentives for consumers to to use those goods sparingly. They also create extra
        allocative efficiency. Plus, supermarkets would never dare to make up for their losses by increasing the price
        of other products.
